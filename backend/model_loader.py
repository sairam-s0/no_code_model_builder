# backend/model_loader.py

# This module is responsible for loading the correct pre-trained models.
# In a real application, this is where you would import libraries like
# transformers, timm, or torch to load models from hubs.

# This map helps translate the user-friendly name to a specific model ID
# that a library like Hugging Face Transformers would use.
